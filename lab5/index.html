			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main point of this lab was to get used to JavaScript code by defining the variables of a car.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Minimal problems arose and I was able to work them out with my partner (Corbin).</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment reminded me the work I did for a previous coding class I took (CSE 20). One of the assignments was this exact assignment was an exact replica of one that I did in Python where we defined the variables of a car in that language. Overall, because of my knowledge, this assignment was very straightforward. It felt like visiting an old friend haha :)</p>
