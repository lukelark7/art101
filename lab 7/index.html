			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main point of this lab was to make a function that gave the option for a user to input something and for the returned output to show on our HTML.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Similar to Lab 6, I had issues with my Javascript not outputting to my website properly, but I was able to solve them with the help of my partner and Wesbot.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Similar to Lab Four, this section has a theme too! This time, it is themed around the iconic character name title screen from the game <i>Earthbound</i>. I even made the variables in the code each of the inputs that the player gets in Earthbound to name the characters. It was a very fun way to try out functions!</p>
