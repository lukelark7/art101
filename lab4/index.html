			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main point of this lab was to create pseudocode using two prompts: pseudocode of an every day task and pseudocode of a simple, well-known game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My parten and I had minor issues with phrasing in our pseudocode but this was easily solved during discussion we had.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went well! My partner loved my idea for making our rock-paper-scissors game based off the rock-paper-scissors mechanics in one of my favorite video games: <i>Fire Emblem</i>
					Giving our work a theme gave our work a little bit more personality and allowed me to share my knowledge about the game to my partner :)</p>
