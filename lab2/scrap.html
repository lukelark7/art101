	<p> Corbin is my partner for Lab Two. They are very cool and we worked so well on this assignment because of their awesome coolness ðŸ˜Ž. We will be watching the greatest show of all time (<i>Stranger Things</i>) and we are making cookies (so swag) after this assignment. They told me to write:</p>
	<style>
		.b {
			font-family: 'Comic Sans', cursive;
		}
	</style>
	<div class = "b">
